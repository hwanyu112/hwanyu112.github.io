#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D Student of artificial intelligence at the [State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems (MAIS)](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/) in [the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://www.ia.cas.cn/) . Before starting my Ph.D, I was an undergraduate student in Automation at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).

I‚Äôm deeply passionate about advancing the frontiers of ‚Äãmultimodal large models‚Äã and their ‚Äãreasoning capabilities, with a particular focus on unlocking their potential through the integration of ‚Äãvision and text. My research interests span ‚Äãmultimodal reasoning, ‚Äãtime series analysis, and the development of novel methodologies to empower large models with more ‚Äãintriguing and surprising capabilities.
